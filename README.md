Game title
"Martti Invasion"

Project Title
My first ever game I coded.

Author
Rain Hans Kibena

I coded the game mainly myself. Got a bit of help from the teacher.

Description
The aim of the game is to kill all the invading Marttis with the space ship. The car is able to shoot as many bullets as you like. You have a total of 3 lives that you can use until you "die". If you do not die, then you are able to basically play forever.

Dependencies
You will have to import pygame if you are using pycharm for example.
You may use any OS that supports python codes.

Installing
At the moment I believe the best way to play this game is to download it and then use a program called PyCharm, or anything that is similar to the program. Once you download both the program and the game, then you should be able to unzip and insert the files of the game into the program. And before you launch the game you will need to import a plugin called pygame.

Here is a link to PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
